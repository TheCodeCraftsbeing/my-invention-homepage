## AI-Powered Tone Changer

**Goal:** To provide a simple tool that modifies the tone of user-provided text using AI.

**Intended Functionality:**

1.  **Input:** A text area where the user can paste their original content.
2.  **Tone Selection:** Checkboxes for common tones:
    *   [ ] Formal
    *   [ ] Professional
    *   [ ] Client-Facing
    *   [ ] Friendly
    *   [ ] Other (If selected, an input field appears for the user to specify a custom tone, e.g., "Humorous", "Empathetic", "Urgent").
3.  **Processing:**
    *   When the user submits, the text and selected tone(s) (including any custom input) will be sent to a backend endpoint.
    *   This endpoint will securely use an API key to call the Google Gemini API.
    *   A prompt will be constructed instructing Gemini to rewrite the text in the desired tone(s).
4.  **Output:** The rewritten text, generated by Gemini, will be displayed back to the user.

**Technology Stack (Planned):**

*   **Frontend:** HTML form, JavaScript (to handle input, selection logic, and API calls using `fetch`).
*   **Backend:** Serverless Function (e.g., Vercel/Netlify Function using Node.js) to handle the Gemini API call securely.
*   **AI:** Google Gemini API.

**Status:** Idea / Planned. The interactive demo is not yet built.
